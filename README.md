## Aim of the Project
In objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of various Active Learning approaches in reducing labeling effort for defect detection in manufacturing coils. Specifically,this study aims to assess whether AL-based instance selection for labeling can outperform traditional Random Sampling. Additionally, we also compare the effectiveness of various AL query strategies and the performance of the models. We tackle the following research questions -

Research Question 1 : Does active learning surpass random sampling?
Research Question 2: Which active learning query strategies do not result in worse results compared to random sampling?
Research Question 3: Does the gain over random sampling justified considering the overhead costs involved?
